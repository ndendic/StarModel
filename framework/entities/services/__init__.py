"""
Entity Services - Composition-Based Entity Capabilities

ðŸ§© Composition Over Inheritance:
This module provides service interfaces that entities use through dependency injection
rather than inheritance. This creates cleaner separation of concerns and more testable code.

Services:
- PersistenceService: Handle entity persistence operations
- SignalService: Manage reactive signals for UI binding
- EventService: Process @event method execution
- ValidationService: Handle entity validation
- MetricsService: Track entity operation metrics
