"""
Entities - The Heart of StarModel

ðŸŽ¯ Entity-Centric Design Philosophy:
Entities are domain objects that contain both data and behavior.
They are the primary building blocks of StarModel applications.

Structure:
- lifecycle/: Entity creation, updates, deletion, and state management
- behavior/: Business logic, @event methods, and domain rules
- composition/: Entity relationships, aggregates, and value objects  
- validation/: Business constraints and validation rules

Example:
    from starmodel.entities import Entity, event
    
    class BlogPost(Entity):
        title: str
        content: str
        published: bool = False
        
        @event
        async def publish(self):
            self.published = True
