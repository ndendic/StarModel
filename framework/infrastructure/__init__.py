"""
Infrastructure - Technical Implementation Adapters

ðŸ”§ Pluggable Technical Components:
Contains all the technical adapters and implementations that connect
StarModel's domain logic to external systems and frameworks.

Structure:
- web/: Web framework adapters (FastHTML, FastAPI, etc.)
- storage/: Database and storage system adapters
- messaging/: Event bus and messaging system implementations
- deployment/: Configuration, setup, and deployment utilities

Example:
    from starmodel.infrastructure.web import FastHTMLAdapter
    from starmodel.infrastructure.deployment import configure_starmodel
    
    # Auto-detect web framework and configure
    app = FastHTML()
    configure_starmodel(app, entities=[User, Product, Order])
