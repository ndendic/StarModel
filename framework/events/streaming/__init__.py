"""
Event Streaming - Pub/Sub Event Bus System

ðŸš€ Reactive Event Architecture:
This module implements the event bus infrastructure for publishing
and subscribing to domain events, enabling reactive patterns and
loose coupling between system components.

Components:
- EventBus: Abstract event bus interface
- InProcessEventBus: In-memory pub/sub implementation
- EventSubscriber: Base class for event handlers
- EventFilters: Event filtering and routing utilities
