"""
Events - Event-Driven Interactions

ðŸš€ Command-Based Architecture:
Events represent user actions and system commands that trigger entity behavior.
This module handles the complete event lifecycle from command to response.

Structure:
- commands/: Event definitions, @event decorator, and command metadata
- handlers/: Event processing logic and middleware pipeline
- dispatching/: Command routing, execution, and coordination
- streaming/: Event buses, pub/sub messaging, and event streams

Example:
    from starmodel.events import event, EventDispatcher
    
    class ShoppingCart(Entity):
        items: List[str] = []
        
        @event(description="Add item to cart")
        async def add_item(self, item: str, quantity: int = 1):
            self.items.append(f"{quantity}x {item}")
