"""
Persistence Transactions - ACID Operations and Coordination

ðŸ’¾ Clean Transaction Management:
This module implements transaction coordination across multiple
persistence backends and domain events, ensuring data consistency
and proper rollback capabilities.

Components:
- UnitOfWork: Transaction coordination pattern
- TransactionManager: Backend-specific transaction handling
- DomainEvent: Event representation for publishing
- TransactionScope: Context manager for transactions
