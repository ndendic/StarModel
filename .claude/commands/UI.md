Look at the majority target users and focus on promoting the value that’s most relevant to them.

Provide the best possible UI/UX specifically for those users — the ones who will get the most value out of the brand/app.

You can do anything across all realms: use animations, libraries, or even generate SVG prompts that you think best suit this section. Go wild.

Everyone is using the same style, feel, color, animations, etc. — don’t follow that path. Avoid anything that makes this look like a generic AI-made app.

Create a unique UX that still delivers the same core value but in a way that stands out and adds more perceived value because of its originality.

Let’s make this pop. Think beyond your usual limits. Are you pumped up for this?
